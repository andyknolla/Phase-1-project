# Weather app

This is a weather application which allows you the user to type in any city and get back the current information of the city that they typed in. Not every city/town is accessible but all major cities around the globe should have no problems.

Feel free to try smaller towns if it doesn't find the city/town that you want nothing will happen. In addition showing the weather the background on the page should show an image that has to do with the city. The more major the city the better the chances of getting a cool pic, but sometimes it's not that great of a picture and in some case there will be no picuture at all. I use the API from openweathermap.org and the background pictures are taken from unsplash.com

I tried but was unable to impliment the time of the sunrise and the sunset of the each city. Also sometime eve when you put in major city you get a very random picture that has nothing to do with the city.
